#Variables:

number1 = 2
print(number1)

number2 = 3
print(number2)

sum = number1 + number2
print(sum)

#Rules to follow on variables :

"""

No spaces between names -> number 1
Can't start with simbols except _ -> %number
Only can have alphanumeric characters
Recommended the snake_case rule -> number_1
Python can recognize between Caps -> Number1 != number1
We cannot use the reserved words for variables names -> if, else, for, etc.
Recommended a logic and representative name for the variables:
    Example: 
    name = "Abad" -> This is correct, because it's a name.
    name = 2 -> This is incorrect, because it's not a name.
